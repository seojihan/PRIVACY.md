1. Core Philosophy
Privacy First
We do not collect your data. Period. Every piece of information remains exclusively within your browser's local storage — never transmitted, never exposed.
Serverless Architecture
With no backend servers, there is zero risk of data breaches. Postrix responds instantly, regardless of your internet connection status.
Pure Web Technology
Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no unnecessary libraries, no bloated frameworks. Postrix is engineered to be exceptionally lightweight, ensuring zero impact on your browser's performance.

2. Workspace Management: Auto Mode & Pin
Postrix intelligently recognizes the pages you visit and manages your workspace accordingly.
📍 Auto Workspace (Auto Mode)
When visiting a standard website, Postrix analyzes the URL and automatically loads the widgets associated with that page. Resume exactly where you left off — no configuration required.
📌 Pin Current Page — Highly Recommended
Websites built on SPA (Single Page Application) frameworks — such as YouTube or Gmail — dynamically update URLs without full page reloads, which can interfere with automatic workspace detection.
Solution: Use the "Pin Current Page" button to assign a name and anchor your workspace to a specific page. This manually created workspace acts as a stable anchor, ensuring your widgets remain intact even as the URL shifts.
Additionally, you can create multiple pins within a single site — for example, separating "Work" and "Study" workspaces — and switch between widget sets seamlessly.

3. Widget Lineup
📝 Memo
Capture ideas the moment they strike. Fast, simple, and always within reach.
✅ Checklist
Manage your to-dos, tasks, or shopping lists with ease. A built-in progress bar keeps your productivity visible.
🗄️ Section
Group multiple widgets into a single organized unit. Free-form drawing (Pen tool) is also available within sections.
📋 Clipboard
Every time you copy text (Ctrl+C) on the web, it's automatically logged in your Clipboard widget — accessible globally across all pages.
🔗 Quick Link
Consolidate your most-visited or project-related URLs into one convenient hub.

4. Site Editing & Widget Linking
✏️ Edit Text
Temporarily modify webpage text to preview layouts or annotate content for personal reference.
🔗 Link Widget
Connect any widget to a specific page element — a button, image, or section. Clicking that element instantly highlights the linked widget for immediate access.

5. Technical Notes
Live Widget Limitations
Live Widgets, which retrieve real-time data, perform optimally on static page structures. On SPA-based sites such as YouTube, real-time data tracking may be limited. In such cases, we recommend utilizing standard Memo or Checklist widgets as alternatives.
Data Deletion Warning
The "Delete All Data" function permanently removes all Postrix data stored in your browser. As no server-side backup exists, please proceed with caution.

6. Data Management
Active
Displays all widgets currently associated with the active page or pin.
Storage
A secure holding area for widgets you don't need on-screen right now, but may wish to retrieve later.
Trash
Deleted widgets are moved here. Restore or permanently delete them at any time.
